# Helen Ly's Portfolio

Welcome! As I continue to learn and create new projects to practice my knowledge and skills within the data analytics field, creating a portfolio is a great way to showcase my projects and present a bit about myself.

Currently, I am working on putting my portfolio together before deploying it live. Below, you will see a few screenshots of how it renders.

Below, is the top of the portfolio. It has a picture of me, my brand statement and a navigation bar at the top right. You are able to see my portfolio of my showcased projects, learn more about me and my educational background, and ways to connect with me.

I would like to highlight the portfolio section. As you can see below, you can click into each project and a pop-up window will appear. It will provide a quick summary of the project and when you click the *View Code* button, it will take you to my repository for this project.

## Future Work

The portfolio is not finished. I will include more projects to showcase and upload a polished resume before this portfolio becomes live.

## Usage

If you would like to use this template:

1. Download all the files within the template folder.
